VVV can play a beep sound at the end of a long task. If the task takes more than the number of seconds in the <b>Beep for tasks longer than</b> text box the program will beep. If the task takes less than that number of seconds VVV will not beep. A value of 0 seconds will cause VVV to always beep. Type a very large number to suppress beeping.
