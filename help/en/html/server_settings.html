Server settings</span><br>

This window contains the&nbsp;server connection settings, &nbsp;needed to connect to a catalog stored in another computer. <a href="network_usage.html">Click here for more information</a>.<br>
<br>
If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Connect to a network server</span>
is not checked you will only be able to open catalogs stored in this
computer. You will not be able to access catalogs through the network.
This is the default setting.<br>
<br>
If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Connect to a network server</span> is checked VVV will connect to a database server to access catalogs. You must enter information about the server connection.<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Server</span> is the name or the
IP address of the server computer. Type "localhost" (without quotes) if
the server is running in this computer. You could also type the
computer's name, but VVV uses the localhost name to know that it is
running in the server so that it can be a little more user-friendly
when opening or creating a catalog.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Username</span> is used to connect to the server. The default value is "SYSDBA" (without quotes).</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Password</span> is used to
connect to the server. The default value for Windows installations (and
some Linux ones) is "masterkey" (without quotes).</li>
</ul>

You can click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test server connection</span>
button to check if the server name is correct. This button will only
use the server name, it will not test username and password.<br>
