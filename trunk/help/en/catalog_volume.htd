This window is used to catalog the content of a volume, like a CD or a DVD disk.<P>

Insert a disk, select or type the path of the CD/DVD drive and press the <B>Get volume name</B> button to see the disk name in the <B>Volume name</B> textbox. At the moment the <B>Get volume name</B> button is only available in the Windows version of VVV.<BR>
You can edit the volume name: that name will be used to show the volume in the program.<P>
Now press the <B>Catalog</B> button to read the disk content. The disk name will be added at the top of the list of cataloged volumes in the lower part of the window. In the Windows version the list will also contain the name read directly from the volume, in case you changed it.<P>
You can insert another disk and repeat these steps many times if you like, then press the <B>Close</B> button to return to the main window.<P>
