VVV can play a beep sound at the end of a long task. If the task takes more than the number of seconds in the <b>Beep for tasks longer than</b> text box the program will beep. If the task takes less than that number of seconds VVV will not beep. A value of 0 seconds will cause VVV to always beep. Type a very large number to suppress beeping.<P>

VVV might have been translated in your language. If the translation is available VVV will use it by default, so you will see it in your language.<BR>
If <B>Use VVV in English</B> is checked VVV will be forced to use the English translation. If you change this setting you will have to restart VVV to make it work.
