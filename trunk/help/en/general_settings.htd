If <B>Reopen the last used catalog at startup</B> is checked VVV  will automatically open the last used catalog when you will start the program again.
If it is not checked VVV will not open any catalog at startup.<p>

VVV can play a beep sound at the end of a long task. If the task takes more than the number of seconds in the <b>Beep for tasks longer than</b> text box the program will beep. If the task takes less than that number of seconds VVV will not beep. A value of 0 seconds will cause VVV to always beep. Type a very large number to suppress beeping.<P>

VVV might have been translated in your language. If the translation is available VVV will use it by default, so you will see it in your language.<BR>
You can press the <B>Change language</B> button to choose a language among the available ones. This will open a window with a languages list. The first entry is always the default language for your computer.<BR>
Note that under Linux you can select a language only if its support has been intalled in the operating system.
