VVV uses a relational database to store its data. This adds a lot of
power to the program because it can handle large amounts of data
without problems. The database is available in two versions: embedded
and full server.<br>



<br>



Each copy of VVV contains the embedded version of the database. This
version does not require installation and it is invisible to the user:
it is the default version and it can only open catalogs stored in the
local hard disks. It cannot open catalog stored in another computer in
the network, for a series of good reasons.<br>



<br>


Often, when&nbsp;many computers are connected by a network, users would
like to share the same catalog among all the networked computers. With
VVV this is possible, but you must install a full copy of the database
server in a computer. That computer will store the catalogs and it will
share them with other computers: we will call it the server. Other computers will connect to the server to access catalogs.<br>

<br>

<span class="title title2">How to install the database server</span><br class="title title2">

<br>

You will need to install the database server only if you want to share
catalogs among many computers connected by a network. You do not need
to install it if you only want to open catalogs stored in your computer.<br>

<br>

VVV uses the <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/">Firebird database server</a>.
It is a free, open source server available for both Linux and Windows
computers. You can install the server in a Windows or Linux computer
and all the networkd computers will be able to access the server.
Windows computers can connect to a Linux server, and Linux computers
can connect to a Windows server. You will need version 2.x of the
server: you can download it from the Firebird home page, but below you
will find direct links.<br>

<br>
<span class="title3">
Install the server in a Windows computer</span><br class="title3">

<br>

The simplest way to install the server is to use the installer: <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/firebird/Firebird-2.0.3.12981-1-Win32.exe">click here to&nbsp;download version 2.0.3</a>.
This is a link to the 2.0.3 version: you might want to look in the home
page if a newer version is available. Installation is very simple: just
execute the installer and follow the instructions. If you are not an
experienced user it is advisable to accept all the default settings.
The installer will ask if you want to run the server as a service or as
an application. The simplest way is to run it as a service. It is
better to let Firebird start automatically when you start the computer
so you will be able to forget about having the server installed.<br>
<br>
In order to connect to the server from VVV you will need a username and
a password: after installation a Windows server will have a <span style="font-weight: bold;">SYSDBA</span> username with the password <span style="font-weight: bold;">masterkey</span>.<br>

<br>
<span class="title3">Install the server in a Linux computer</span><br class="title3">
<br>
There are different ways to install the server in a Linux computer.
First it is better to check if a Firebird package is available for your
distibution. If a package is available that is the simplest way to
install the server. Be sure to install version 2. The server comes in
different flavours: if you are in doubt try installing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">classic</span> server. After installation you might want to read the release notes from the link below.<br>
<br>

If a package is not available for your distribution you can download the server from the <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=files&amp;id=engine_203">download page</a>
of the official site. This is a link to the 2.0.3 version: you might
want to look in the home page if a newer version is available. There
are many Linux versions: if you are in doubt download the <span style="font-weight: bold;">classic</span>
one. You can choose between a rpm package or a .tar.gz file for
distributions that do not support rpm packages. You may want to read
the release&nbsp;notes linked at the end of the download page for
information about installing the server.<br>

<br>
In order to connect to the server from VVV you will need a username and
a password: after installation a Linux server will have a <span style="font-weight: bold;">SYSDBA</span> username, but it might have different passwords, depending on the used package.<br>
Some packages will ask for a SYSDBA password during installation, others will use a default <span style="font-weight: bold;">masterkey</span> password, others will create a file containing a random password (/opt/firebird/SYSDBA.password for the official package).<br>
<br>
<span class="title2">How to configure VVV</span><br class="title2">
<span class="title2" style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
You must change some settings to make VVV connect to the server. Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tools/Options</span> menu to show the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Settings</span> window, then click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Server</span> tab.<br>
Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Connect to a network server</span> checkbox and fill the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Server</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Username</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Password</span> text boxes.<br>
Username and Password contain, by default, "SYSDBA" and "masterkey",
the default values for a Windows server and some Linux servers.<br>
Enter the name of the server computer in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Server</span>
textbox. If the server is running in the same computer enter
"localhost" (without quotes) instead of the computer name. This makes
VVV a little friendlier when opening a catalog.<br>
<br>
If you are connecting to a server, opening a catalog works in a slightly different way. When you chose the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Open</span>
command a new window is displayed, asking for the path to the catalog
file. Since the catalog is stored in the server, you must type the full
path relative to the server, that is the path that you see when you
work at the server computer. <br>
So, if the server is a Windows computer, the path
"C:\Catalogs\Catalog1.vvv" will point to the "C" disk of the server,
not the "C" disk of the client. You must tipe a Windows path if the
server is a Windows computer, even if you are connecting from a Linux
computer, and vice versa.<br>
<br>
Since usually a client cannot see the files stored in the server you
must manually type the path for the first time that you use it. VVV
cannot help you showing a "file open" dialog. Then you will ba able to
find the path in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">File</span> menu.<br>
If you are using VVV in the server computer and you typed "localhost"
in the settings window, VVV will show a browse button at the side of
the catalog name to let you visually choose the catalog name. Since VVV
is running in the server it can look at the stored files as usual.<br>
<br>
Creating a new catalog works in a similar way, but you can do it only
if VVV is running in the server computer. Clients usually cannot access
files in the server, so they cannot create them.<br>
<br>
<span class="title2">Security</span><br class="title2">
<br>
This instructiosn have explained how to connect to a server using the
SYSDBA username. This is the simplest way to connect to the server, but
it is important to understand that it can cause security problems.<br>
<br>
The SYSDBA user has full access to every database stored in the server,
so anybody who knows the SYSDBA password can connect to another
database, non only a VVV catalog. Then he can read data and even
destroy them.<br>
<br>
This is usually not a problem if the server only stores VVV catalogs,
or if it stores other database containing similar, non-sensitive
information.<br>
It can be a problem if the server also stores sensitive and important data like accounting or medical information.<br>
<br>
It is usually not a problem in a home network where users are trusted,
while it can be a problem il a large network where not all users are so
trusted.<br>
<br>
If security is a problem it is possible to create a new username and
give it only the right to access VVV catalogs. People connecting with
that username would not be able to access other databases.<br>
If you already have sensitive data stored in the Firebird server you
certainly have a server administrator that will be able to add and
configure a new username for VVV users.<br>
